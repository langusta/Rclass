Below you can see how each of the colors returned by _colors()_ function looks like.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
c <- colors()
for (k in seq_along(c)){
   plot.new()
   par(pin = c(6.5,0.25))
   plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,2))
   rect(0,0,10,2,col = c[k])
   text(5,1, c[k], col = c[1+ (k+300)%%length(c) ])
}
```
